                  eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While
                  supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of
                  the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged
                  for all items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice
                  regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly
                  Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting
                  ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at
                  checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off
                  the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in one ACMI installment
                  plan over 12 months for the eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit,
                  and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple
                  Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI
                  installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible
                  Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the
                  Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the eligible Mac or
                  iPad. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple
                  Card other than ACMI range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates
                  as of August 10, 2023. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option
                  for an ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at
                  checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple
                  Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to
                  your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at
                  https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf(Opens

                  Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or
                  added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
                  qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales
                  tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In-store trade-in

                  Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only
                  available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible Apple products
                  purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com(Opens in a new window), the Apple
                  Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and
                  credit limit. See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens in a new window) for
                  more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you
                  accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and/or after
                  August 10, 2023: variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24%
                  to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10, 2023. Existing
                  cardholders: see your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy
                  an ACMI eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of
                  using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR.
                  Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR.
                  You’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check
                  out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers
                  at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following
                  special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee
                  Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans
                  and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. The last month’s
                  payment for each product will be the product's purchase price, less all other
                  payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any
                  time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and
                  eligible products. See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens in a new
